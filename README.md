# EyeDiseaseClassificationVGG16
This study addresses the critical issue of diabetic eye diseases, including retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma, which pose significant risks of visual impairment and blindness among individuals with diabetes. Leveraging a diverse dataset of retinal images, comprising approximately 4000 images, the research develops a graphical user interface (GUI) integrated with advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to assist healthcare professionals in accurately classifying diabetic eye diseases, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy, facilitating early detection, streamlining clinical workflow, supporting preventive care, and promoting awareness. The methodology involves problem identification, dataset acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection and architecture design, model training and evaluation, and GUI development and integration. Results demonstrate an 85% accuracy in image classification using the VGG16 convolutional neural network and showcase a user-friendly GUI for dataset upload, single image classification, DICOM conversion, and DICOM image review. The system's successful implementation suggests its potential to improve patient outcomes by enabling early detection and timely intervention. Future work may entail further model refinement and integration with electronic health record systems for seamless clinical deployment.
